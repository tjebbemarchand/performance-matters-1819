# Performance Matters
## Installation
To install the OBA server side app, you need to Git clone the repository. After that you can run an NPM install on the directory of the app to install all the dependencies the app needs.

    ```
    # git clone https://github.com/tjebbemarchand/tjebbe-wafs.github.io.git
    # npm install
    ```

## Tooling
I used NPM scripts to prefix and minify my CSS stylesheet. To run the build css command, simply run the following command in your terminal.

    ```
    # npm run build:css
    ```
